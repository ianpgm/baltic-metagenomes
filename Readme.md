This repository contains all code and commands necessary to reproduce the majority of plots in the paper tentatively titled "Shift in microbial community composition in response to a changing subsurface environment: metagenomic evidence from deep Baltic Sea sediments" by Ian P.G. Marshall, Søren M. Karst, Per H. Nielsen, and Bo B. Jørgensen. If you have questions please contact Ian at ianpgm at bios dot au dot dk.

Code is written in [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). The best place to start is the file `figure_plotting_noreps.jl`.
